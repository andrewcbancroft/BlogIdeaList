# Getting Started With NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

## Overview

What is it like to sync data from Core Cata to iCloud using Apple's new `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`?  Here I provide an example project for saving and syncing a single Core Data Entity with CloudKit using this new class.

This sample code project is associated [Getting Started With NSPersistentCloudKitContainer](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/blog/ios-development/data-persistence/getting-started-with-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer/).

## Configure the Sample Code Project

Before you run the sample code project in Xcode:

1. Set your bundle identifier. In the project settings, under General, in the Identity section, set the Bundle Identifier to your reverse domain name followed by the project name.  
2. Set your development team. In the project settings, under Signing & Capabilities, select your development team from the dropdown list.
