# Getting Started With NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

## Overview

What is it like to sync data from Core Cata to iCloud using Apple's new `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`?  Here I provide an example project for saving and syncing a single Core Data Entity with CloudKit using this new class.

This sample code project is associated [Getting Started With NSPersistentCloudKitContainer](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/blog/ios-development/data-persistence/getting-started-with-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer/).

## Configure the Sample Code Project

Before you run the sample code project in Xcode:

1. Set your bundle identifier. In the project settings, under General, in the Identity section, set the Bundle Identifier to **your** reverse domain name followed by the project name.  
2. Set your development team. In the project settings, under Signing & Capabilities, select your development team from the dropdown list.
